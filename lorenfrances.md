To open Python from within the terminal (bash shell), type *python*. When Python in running, the **$ ~** will become **>>>**. The command *quit()* will quit Python and return to the bash shell. 

Python v3 is the industry standard, and has some differences from Python v2. Notably, division operations for Integers and Floating Points are reversed and no brackets are required in the *print* function in v2 (ie: *print(2)* becomes *print2*).

> The dog will only understand specific command words (sit, stay, fetch, etc.) but not complex sentences. 

The following commands are helpful within the Jupyter (iPython Notebook) environment:
* X = cut
* V = paste
* B = add cell below
* A = add cell above
