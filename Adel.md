In the beginning, we were taught how to create a shell of python or ipython. To this end, first, we created a github account used to get connected to python notebook in Jupyter. Once we did this, we learned fundamental rules e.g. division or multiplication in shell environemnt. We leanred what pwd (print work directort), mkdir (make directory), ls (list), and rm (remove) are. Then, we were taught how to move to python or ipython in shell environemt. Finally, we moved to jupyter notebook and became familier with its environment. The most important thing we've leanred so far, is how to find out about shortcuts in jupyter notebook which seems necessary for programming. Just type esc+H will give you list of all available shortcuts.
